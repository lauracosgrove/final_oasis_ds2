# Analysis Plan

We aim to diagnose Dementia/Non-Dementia using count of APOE risk/protective alleles and anatomical volumes derived from Freesurfer analysis of MRI scans, adjusting for height,  weight, and age. 

*I don't think we should use MMSE (which is another way dementia is assessed) in our models*. We also shouldn't use `year_round` or `subject`. However, they are still currently in the cog_data file.

We will compare a series of models:

- Logistic regression

- Linear discriminant analysis

- K-nearest neighbors

- Naive Bayes 

- Classification trees (CART)

- Gradient boosting machine -- more difficult to tune than random forest

- Random forest classifier -- pretty robust to bad tuning

- Support vector machines

Visualization:

- Variable importance

- partial dependence plots

- LIME algorithm approximates complicated black box model with simpler model
